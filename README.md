# What2Eat Web App

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project was based on the Forkify Web App created by Jonas Schmedtmann in his course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!". I have realized his Web App was not responsive, so it was not functional on a tablet/smartphone. Therefore, I decided to recreate the project making it responsive and implementing a shopping list feature.
